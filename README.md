HashUtil
A small app to calculate and compare any checksum hash.

Usage
There are 5 buttons: "select file," "refresh," "check," "copy to clipboard," and "exit."
There is one drop down list for selecting the algorithm (i.e. md5, sha256, sha512, et al).
There is a text box to display the hash.
Once a file has been selected, the process of calculating by whatever algorythm was selected begins automatically.
Once the calculation is complete, the hash is displayed and--if you have copied a hash to the clipboard--you can then check to see if the checksums match with the "check" button or copy the hash to the clipboard with the "copy to clipboard" button.
If you would like to refactor the file, select a new algorythm and push the "refresh" button.
During the calculation process, a sound plays while the file is being factored and ends when the process is complete.
The "exit" button closes out the program.
